# Security Integration

## Existing Security Measures
**Authentication:** Secure AuthManager with API-Key and Client-Id headers, credential validation with empty/null checks
**Authorization:** Per-request authentication headers applied consistently across all API calls
**Data Protection:** Branded types prevent ID confusion (ProductId vs OfferId), readonly properties prevent mutation, no credential logging
**Security Tools:** npm audit in CI/CD pipeline, secret detection in GitHub Actions, comprehensive error handling without data exposure

## Enhancement Security Requirements
**New Security Measures:** None required - existing patterns cover all categories uniformly
**Integration Points:** All 31 new categories use same AuthManager.getAuthHeaders() for consistent authentication
**Compliance Requirements:** Maintains existing secure credential handling and error reporting without data leakage

## Security Testing
**Existing Security Tests:** Authentication validation, credential format testing, error handling without data exposure
**New Security Test Requirements:** Each of 31 categories tested for secure credential handling and error response safety
**Penetration Testing:** Not applicable - SDK client library, security responsibility shared with consumer applications
