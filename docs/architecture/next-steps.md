# Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff
Ready for story creation and development planning. Key integration requirements validated:
- All 31 new categories follow established ProductApi patterns
- Existing core infrastructure (HttpClient, AuthManager, error handling) scales automatically
- Zero breaking changes to existing Product API functionality
- Comprehensive testing and deployment infrastructure already in place

## Developer Handoff
Architecture ready for immediate implementation:
- **Reference Implementation:** ProductApi serves as perfect template for all 31 categories
- **Technical Patterns:** Constructor injection, async methods, TypeScript strict typing, JSDoc documentation
- **Quality Standards:** Existing ESLint/Prettier/Vitest configuration applies to all new code
- **Performance Requirements:** Tree-shaking support, bundle size monitoring, build time tracking all operational

**Implementation Sequence Recommendation:**
1. Start with high-priority categories (Analytics, Finance) using ProductApi as template
2. Implement core business categories (Posting, Returns, Stocks) to validate patterns
3. Complete remaining categories following established patterns
4. Comprehensive testing and documentation validation throughout
