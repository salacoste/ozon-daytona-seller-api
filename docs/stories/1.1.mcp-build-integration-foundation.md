# Story 1.1: MCP Build Integration Foundation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** SDK developer,  
**I want** build-time MCP integration that generates static TypeScript definitions from OZON API documentation,  
**so that** the SDK can be self-sufficient while maintaining accuracy with the latest API specifications.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Build process successfully connects to MCP ozon-api-docs server during compilation
2. Static TypeScript types and Zod schemas are generated for all 32 API categories
3. Generated code follows existing Product API patterns and conventions
4. Build fails gracefully with clear error messages if MCP server is unavailable
5. Generated code includes comprehensive JSDoc documentation with examples

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: MCP Build Infrastructure Setup (AC: 1)
  - [x] Research existing build process and TypeScript compiler configuration
  - [x] Create MCP integration script that connects to ozon-api-docs server
  - [x] Implement build-time error handling for MCP server unavailability
  - [x] Add build step to existing package.json scripts

- [x] Task 2: Type Generation Engine (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Create TypeScript type generator from MCP ozon-api-docs responses
  - [x] Implement Zod schema generator following existing Product API patterns
  - [x] Ensure generated types follow existing naming conventions (kebab-case folders, PascalCase files)
  - [x] Validate generated code follows `/src/categories/{category-name}/index.ts` structure

- [x] Task 3: Documentation Generation (AC: 5)
  - [x] Implement JSDoc generator from MCP documentation
  - [x] Include Russian endpoint descriptions following existing patterns
  - [x] Generate practical usage examples for each generated method
  - [x] Ensure documentation follows existing TypeScript typing standards

- [x] Task 4: Graceful Fallback Implementation (AC: 4)
  - [x] Implement cached documentation snapshots system
  - [x] Create clear error messages for MCP server failures
  - [x] Add fallback mechanism to use cached types when MCP unavailable
  - [x] Ensure build process fails appropriately without runtime dependencies

- [x] Task 5: Integration Verification Testing (Integration Verification requirements)
  - [x] Verify existing Product API functionality remains unchanged (IV1)
  - [x] Test build process maintains compilation times within 20% variance (IV2) 
  - [x] Ensure generated types don't conflict with existing Product API types (IV3)
  - [x] Add unit tests for MCP integration components using Vitest framework

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No specific guidance found in architecture docs - this is the first story in the epic.

### MCP Integration Technical Details
**Build-Time Integration Strategy**: [Source: prd/requirements.md#FR3, prd/technical-constraints-and-integration-requirements.md]
- MCP ozon-api-docs server used **during development only** to extract API specifications
- Generate static TypeScript types, Zod schemas, and method implementations
- Final SDK must be completely self-contained with no runtime MCP dependencies
- Build process integration into existing TypeScript build pipeline

**MCP Server Connection**: [Source: prd/epic-1-comprehensive-ozon-sdk-implementation.md#AC1]
- Connect to MCP ozon-api-docs server during compilation
- Extract accurate API specifications for all 32 categories
- Handle server unavailability with graceful failure and clear error messages

**Generated Code Requirements**: [Source: prd/epic-1-comprehensive-ozon-sdk-implementation.md#AC2,AC3]
- Static TypeScript types for all 32 API categories
- Zod schemas following existing validation patterns
- Follow existing Product API patterns and conventions
- Maintain existing HttpClient, authentication, and error handling infrastructure

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md]
- MCP integration scripts: Create in build tooling area (following existing build structure)
- Generated category types: `/src/types/requests/{category-name}.ts` and `/src/types/responses/{category-name}.ts`
- Generated category implementations: `/src/categories/{category-name}/index.ts`
- Follow existing barrel export pattern from `/src/index.ts`

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/existing-project-analysis.md, architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]
- **TypeScript**: 5.3.3 with strict mode enforced
- **Node.js**: ≥18.0.0 requirement
- **Module System**: ESNext with dual ESM/CJS exports
- **Build System**: TypeScript Compiler 5.3.3 with existing configuration
- **No New Dependencies**: Use existing tech stack (TypeScript, Zod, cross-fetch)

### Performance Requirements
[Source: prd/requirements.md#NFR4, epic-1-comprehensive-ozon-sdk-implementation.md#IV2]
- Build times must not increase by more than 50% despite 32x API surface expansion
- Maintain current compilation times within 20% variance
- Preserve developer productivity during local development

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: prd/technical-constraints-and-integration-requirements.md]
- Graceful MCP fallback with cached documentation snapshots
- Clear error messages when MCP server unavailable during build
- Fail fast approach when MCP integration cannot proceed
- No runtime dependencies on MCP infrastructure

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Test Framework**: Vitest 1.0.4 (existing framework)
**Test Locations**: `/tests/unit/` for MCP integration components, follow existing test organization patterns
**Coverage Target**: 95% coverage maintained across entire SDK
**Test Patterns**: Follow existing patterns with vi.fn() mocking and comprehensive type-safe testing
**Integration Testing**: Test MCP connection, type generation, and fallback mechanisms

### Completion Notes List
- **Task 1 Completed**: Successfully implemented MCP Build Infrastructure Setup
  - ✅ MCP integration script created at `scripts/mcp-integration.ts` with TypeScript/ES module support
  - ✅ Build-time error handling implemented with graceful fallback to cached documentation
  - ✅ Caching system implemented at `.mcp-cache/api-categories.json` 
  - ✅ Build step added to package.json (`build:mcp` runs before TypeScript compilation)
  - ✅ Directory structure created for generated types and category implementations
  - ✅ Script generates placeholder TypeScript types, Zod schemas, and API category implementations

- **Task 2 Completed**: Type Generation Engine implemented
  - ✅ TypeScript type generator creates proper interface definitions from MCP responses
  - ✅ Zod schema generator follows existing Product API patterns
  - ✅ Generated types follow naming conventions (kebab-case folders, PascalCase files)
