# Story 1.4: Category Implementation - Product & Inventory Management (29 endpoints)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** OZON seller developer,  
**I want** comprehensive product, returns, and inventory management API categories,  
**so that** I can manage my entire product lifecycle from creation to returns through the unified SDK.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **ProductAPI** (18 endpoints) - Enhanced with complete endpoint coverage from MCP documentation
2. **ReturnsAPI** (1 endpoint) - Return processing and management

4. **Quants** (2 endpoints) - Product quantity and SKU management
5. Cross-category type sharing works correctly (Product types used in Returns/Quants)
6. All pagination helpers work consistently across these 29 endpoints
7. Product lifecycle state management from creation to archival
