# Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

## Overview

This comprehensive Definition of Done checklist ensures that all deliverables meet professional software development standards. Each item must be verified before marking any story, feature, or task as complete.

## Instructions

- Mark each item as `[x] Complete`, `[ ] Not Done`, or `[N/A] Not Applicable`
- Add brief comments for any `[ ]` or `[N/A]` items
- Be honest about completion status - quality over speed
- All `[x]` items must be verified with evidence
