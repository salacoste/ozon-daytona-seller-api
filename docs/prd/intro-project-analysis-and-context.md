# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis

**Current Project State**: 
The project is a TypeScript SDK for OZON Seller API that currently implements only the Product API category out of 32 total available categories. It follows a category-based organization with:
- Core HTTP client with retry logic and idempotency
- Zod schema validation and strict TypeScript typing
- Comprehensive testing framework using Vitest + Nock
- MCP server integration planned for documentation (ozon-api-docs) and best practices (context7)

## Available Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation**:
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation (TypeScript, Vitest, Zod identified)
- ✅ Source Tree/Architecture (Category-based structure visible)
- ⚠️ Coding Standards (Partial - inferred from existing code)
- ✅ API Documentation (OZON API docs via MCP server)
- ✅ External API Documentation (MCP integration planned)
- ❌ UX/UI Guidelines (Not applicable - backend SDK)
- ⚠️ Technical Debt Documentation (Needs assessment)

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**:
- ✅ New Feature Addition (32 API categories to implement)
- ✅ Integration with New Systems (MCP servers)
- ✅ Performance/Scalability Improvements (Comprehensive SDK)

**Enhancement Description**: 
Expand the existing OZON Seller API SDK from 1 category (Product) to a comprehensive TypeScript SDK covering all 32 API categories with full type safety, MCP-first architecture for documentation sourcing, and enterprise-grade testing coverage.

**Impact Assessment**:
- ✅ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes required)
  - Will require expanding core architecture patterns
  - Testing infrastructure needs scaling
  - Documentation generation workflows

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
• Implement a fully typed, category-based OZON SDK covering all 32 API categories
• Achieve MCP-first architecture with ozon-api-docs as source of truth
• Maintain 95%+ test coverage across all categories with comprehensive test types
• Deliver production-ready TypeScript SDK with strict typing and enterprise standards

**Background Context**:
The current SDK implements only the Product API category but has established solid foundations with TypeScript, Zod validation, and testing infrastructure. The enhancement is needed to provide developers with a comprehensive, type-safe interface to the entire OZON Seller API ecosystem. This will eliminate the need for developers to manually interface with 31+ API categories and ensure consistency, type safety, and proper error handling across all integrations.
