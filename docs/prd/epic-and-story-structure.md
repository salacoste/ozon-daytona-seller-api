# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: **Single comprehensive epic** with rationale:

Based on analysis of the existing OZON SDK project, this enhancement is structured as a **single comprehensive epic** because:

1. **Architectural Consistency**: All 32 API categories follow similar patterns established by the existing Product API implementation
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Core components (HTTP client, authentication, error handling, testing framework) are already established and will be extended, not rebuilt
3. **MCP Build Integration**: The build-time MCP integration for documentation generation creates a unified development workflow across all categories
4. **Interdependent Components**: Categories may have cross-references and shared types that benefit from coordinated implementation
5. **Quality Standards**: Maintaining 95% test coverage and TypeScript strict mode requires coordinated approach across all categories
