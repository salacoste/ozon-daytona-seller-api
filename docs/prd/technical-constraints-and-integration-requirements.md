# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript (strict mode enabled)
**Frameworks**: Node.js 18+, Vitest testing framework
**Database**: Not applicable (SDK project)
**Infrastructure**: npm package management, ESM module system
**External Dependencies**: Zod for schema validation, Nock for HTTP mocking, MCP servers for build-time documentation

## Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Not applicable - SDK does not manage databases

**API Integration Strategy**: Build-time MCP integration for documentation extraction, runtime HTTP client for OZON API communication with retry logic and idempotency support

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Not applicable - backend SDK only

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Scale existing Vitest + Nock testing infrastructure to support 32 categories with consistent mocking patterns

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Maintain existing category-based organization (`src/categories/{category-name}/`) with consistent internal structure

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing TypeScript and OZON API naming patterns established in Product category

**Coding Standards**: TypeScript strict mode, Zod validation, comprehensive JSDoc, no implicit any types

**Documentation Standards**: JSDoc with practical examples, automated API documentation generation from types

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Integrate MCP documentation extraction into existing TypeScript build pipeline

**Deployment Strategy**: npm package distribution with tree-shaking support and optional category imports

**Monitoring and Logging**: SDK provides structured error reporting, no built-in monitoring (consumer responsibility)

**Configuration Management**: Extend existing configuration patterns to support all categories consistently

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- MCP server unavailability during build process
- Performance degradation from 32x API surface expansion
- Complex interdependencies between API categories

**Integration Risks**: 
- Breaking changes to existing Product API consumers
- Inconsistent patterns across different API categories
- Testing complexity scaling challenges

**Deployment Risks**: 
- Bundle size impact on consumer applications
- TypeScript compilation performance with expanded surface area
- Version management across 32 categories

**Mitigation Strategies**: 
- Graceful MCP fallback with cached documentation snapshots
- Performance monitoring at each development milestone
- Strict backward compatibility validation in CI/CD
- Tree-shaking implementation for selective category imports
