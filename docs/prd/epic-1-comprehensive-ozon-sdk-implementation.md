# Epic 1: Comprehensive OZON SDK Implementation

**Epic Goal**: Transform the existing single-category OZON SDK into a comprehensive, self-sufficient TypeScript SDK covering all 33 API categories (258 endpoints total) with build-time MCP documentation integration, maintaining backward compatibility and enterprise-grade quality standards.

**Integration Requirements**: 
- Preserve existing Product API patterns and extend them across all categories
- Implement build-time MCP integration for accurate documentation sourcing without runtime dependencies
- Maintain existing HTTP client, authentication, and error handling infrastructure
- Scale testing framework to support 33x category expansion with 95%+ coverage
